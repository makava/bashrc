bashrc
======

My .bashrc file. A few things from an original debian .bashrc file plus a
lot of own modifications. 

Lots of aliases and terminal control sequences.
Also many custom functions, highlights:

extract()

automatically detects correct archive type and extracts the files

mktar(), mktgz(), mktbz() and mkzip()

Creates an archive from a given directory

up() and back()

lets you easily navigate through directorys with and up N and back command

ii() and myip()

Displays host related information

encrypt() and decrypt()

Encrypts and decrypts a given file or directory with gpg. 

argc()

Tests automatically when you open a file if it should be opened normally, 
or as root and asks you for permission.

Have fun! :-)
