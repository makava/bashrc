bashrc
======

## **My .bashrc file**

A few things from an original debian .bashrc file plus a lot of own modifications. 
Lots of aliases and terminal control sequences. Also many custom functions, some highlights are:

**extract( )**  
_automatically detects correct archive type and extracts the files_

**mktar( ), mktgz( ), mktbz( ) and mkzip( )**   
_Creates an archive from a given directory_

**up( ) and back( )**  
_Lets you easily navigate through directorys with and up N and back command_

**ii( ) and myip( )**   
_Displays host related information_

**encrypt( ) and decrypt( )**    
_Encrypts and decrypts a given file or directory with gpg._

**argc( )**  
_Tests automatically when you open a file if it should be opened normally, 
or as root and asks you for permission._

Have fun!  :-)
